# Overview

As a quick practice run of Java, and its GUI libraries, I made two programs -- a cute little one that simply tracks your clicks on a button, and a slightly more robust one that functions as a log-on system.

I saw the idea of this somewhere online, and wanted to figure out how I could make the program without watching the tutorial. I compared afterwards, but overall I think I did pretty well.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode for the entirety of the development. I was tempted a few times to try out 'Eclipse', an oft-recommended IDE software for Java, but I resisted the temptation to add more bloat to my computer.

The main library used in my program is called 'Swing', though I understand now that it is deprecated and not maintained.

# Future Work

* Be able to 'make an account'
* Improve usability (like ensure that the account info txt will load properly)
* Password encryption
